# Sample Python Web Scraper

[Tutorial](https://first-web-scraper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#) explains how to scrape [table data](http://www.showmeboone.com/sheriff/JailResidents/JailResidents.asp) into CSV. I also added export JSON.

## To export to CSV file
- Run `python scrape_to_csv.py'

## To export to JSON file
- Run `python scrape_to_json.py'
